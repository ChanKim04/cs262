Homework1
Changed
- Added documentation for the class. 
- Added a comment explaining the approximate activity for the public function calculate. 
- Added a single space to if, else if and else which have been omitted.

Not Changed
Since the names and behaviors of the values are obvious, descriptions of the values and descriptions of the actions are omitted.

Homework2
Changed
- Changed the name of the values to the proper name because it is the same name we used in the lab before, which can be misleading.
- Added spaces to the binary operators.
- Split long texts longer than 79 characters.
- Deleted unnecessary white space
- Added simple documentation and comment.

Not Changed
Since most of the code came from lab05, I wrote a few of my own code and did not fix much or add a comment because it already had the necessary explanations.
